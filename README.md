# Animal Shelter

## Description

The purpose of this project was to practice some of our first week HTML and CSS elements and to see how inheritance works. In addition to cascading practice, we were introduced to the concepts of columns and how they are created and sized. The other major addition to our repetoire was the use of the 'float' element in CSS. Both the image to the left of this paragraph as well as the ordered list to the right are examples of float applied to a classful div.
